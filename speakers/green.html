				<p><strong><img src="../img/speakers/tom_bw.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Tom Green" />Bio: </strong>Having been involved with Post Secondary education for over a decade and  an active member of the international, national and local New Media  Communities, I have jammed a lot of experience into a relatively short  time frame. Nine books in seven years, a ton of speaking engagements ,  Adobe Community Expert, Adobe Education Leader (Post  Secondary),Community MX partner and other activities are a good example  of that one. The biggest surprise so far has been my being lumped in  with a group of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/designcenter/dialogbox/flash_anniversary/">10 influential Flash Designers</a> that Adobe pulled together to celebrate the 10'th anniversary of Flash.  It was both a huge honor and rather humbling because, to be included in  with that crew, is rather scary. The Flash ride has been one  long,strange trip and it looks like it continues... here's to 10 more  years.</p>
