				<p><strong>Description:</strong> What features could Adobe Edge possibly include that would appeal to designers and developers working in Flash Professional? Well, turns out to be a whole lot! From authoring motion content to rich interactivity for the web, Edge effectively borrows a lot of the familiar constructs and paradigms from Flash Professional - and even improves upon some. We'll walk through similarities between Flash Professional and Edge and how designers familiar with older toolsets can adapt that knowledge when integrating Edge into their workflow. We'll also look at methods of sharing assets and the transport of content between related applications.</p>
