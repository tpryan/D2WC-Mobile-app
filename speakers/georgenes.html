It was not long before he learned how to use both hands and feet as a groove-oriented drummer in a variety of rock bands. Upon standing fully erect, he attended a fine art school and received his BFA. Years later someone invented the Internet, and then another person invented Flash. Riding on the coattails of these two individuals, Georgenes was able to carve a unique niche for himself using both tools. In recent years Chris has been the art director for Say Design Games, Acclaim Games, Playdom Games, Disney Interactive Media Group and is now enjoying being part of the team at Game Show Network Digital as the Director of Creative Development.</p>
