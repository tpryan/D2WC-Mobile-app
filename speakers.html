				<h1>Chris Georgeness<a name="georgenes"></a></h1>

				<p><strong><img src="http://d2wc.com/assets/images/speakers/chrisg_bw.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Chris G" />Bio: </strong>Chris Georgenes started life like most humans, covered in placenta and with minimal motor skills. It was not long before he learned how to use both hands and feet as a groove-oriented drummer in a variety of rock bands. Upon standing fully erect, he attended a fine art school and received his BFA. Years later someone invented the Internet, and then another person invented Flash. Riding on the coattails of these two individuals, Georgenes was able to carve a unique niche for himself using both tools. In recent years Chris has been the art director for Say Design Games, Acclaim Games, Playdom Games, Disney Interactive Media Group and is now enjoying being part of the team at Game Show Network Digital as the Director of Creative Development.</p>

				<p><strong><img src="http://d2wc.com/assets/images/speakers/tom_bw.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Tom Green" />Bio: </strong>Having been involved with Post Secondary education for over a decade and  an active member of the international, national and local New Media  Communities, I have jammed a lot of experience into a relatively short  time frame. Nine books in seven years, a ton of speaking engagements ,  Adobe Community Expert, Adobe Education Leader (Post  Secondary),Community MX partner and other activities are a good example  of that one. The biggest surprise so far has been my being lumped in  with a group of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/designcenter/dialogbox/flash_anniversary/">10 influential Flash Designers</a> that Adobe pulled together to celebrate the 10'th anniversary of Flash.  It was both a huge honor and rather humbling because, to be included in  with that crew, is rather scary. The Flash ride has been one  long,strange trip and it looks like it continues... here's to 10 more  years.</p>

				<p><strong>Description:</strong> What features could Adobe Edge possibly include that would appeal to designers and developers working in Flash Professional? Well, turns out to be a whole lot! From authoring motion content to rich interactivity for the web, Edge effectively borrows a lot of the familiar constructs and paradigms from Flash Professional - and even improves upon some. We'll walk through similarities between Flash Professional and Edge and how designers familiar with older toolsets can adapt that knowledge when integrating Edge into their workflow. We'll also look at methods of sharing assets and the transport of content between related applications.</p>
				<p><strong>Bio</strong>: Joseph Labrecque is primarily employed by the University of Denver as a senior interactive software engineer specializing in the Adobe Flash Platform, where he produces innovative academic toolsets for both traditional desktop environments and emerging mobile spaces.
